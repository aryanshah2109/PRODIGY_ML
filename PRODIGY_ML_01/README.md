PRODIGY_ML_01: House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)
This repository contains Task 01 of the Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship. It implements a linear regression model to predict house prices.

Project Goal
To build and evaluate a simple linear regression model for house price prediction.

Dataset
Uses train.csv and test.csv (from Kaggle's House Prices competition) located in the Data/ directory.

Key Files
PRODIGY_ML_01.py: The main Python script containing the model.
Data/: Contains the datasets (train.csv, test.csv).
models/: (Optional) For storing trained model files.
src/: (Optional) For additional source code.
